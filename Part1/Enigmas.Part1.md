# Enigmas
For our circuit, we decided to create the notorious enigma machine, and so the name we decided on for our cohort is Enigmas (but only because we felt the name 'Nazis' was a bit innaproppriate).

## Source Repository: 
We are using GitHub as a way to keep everything in one place and track modifications made to the project.

## Communication:
We have a server on discord that we use to communicate with each other. 

## Project Description:
We have decided to create an enigma machine, the same machine the Germans used to transmit secret encoded messages during World War II. It uses a complicated circuit with several moving parts that randomly encode your messages. The ALU would be used for several purposes, for example, handling the logic operations involved with rotating each of the rotors that determine which letter is used for encryption.
